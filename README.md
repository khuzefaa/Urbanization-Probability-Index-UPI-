# Urbanization-Probability-Index-UPI-
The Urbanization Probability Index is an AI-powered geospatial analysis system that predicts which rural grid cells are most likely to undergo urbanization in the near future. By leveraging multi-temporal satellite imagery, demographic data, and infrastructure information, this tool provides early warning capabilities for sustainable urban planning
Key Features

Multi-temporal Analysis: Processes time-series satellite data to detect land cover changes
Random Forest Classification: Uses ensemble machine learning for robust urbanization prediction
Change Detection: Identifies patterns in vegetation loss, built-up area expansion, and infrastructure development
Risk Mapping: Generates spatial probability maps for targeted planning interventions
SDG Alignment: Directly supports UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities)

Methodology
Data Sources

Satellite Imagery: Landsat/Sentinel-2 derived indices (NDVI, Built-up Index, LST)
Demographic Data: Population density, growth rates
Infrastructure: Road networks, distance to urban centers
Environmental: Nighttime lights, land surface temperature

Machine Learning Approach

Feature Engineering: Extract temporal change rates and spatial context variables
Random Forest Training: Ensemble classification with cross-validation
Probability Mapping: Generate continuous urbanization risk scores
Validation: Performance assessment using ROC-AUC and confusion matrices

Key Indicators

NDVI Change Rate: Vegetation loss patterns
Built-up Index Growth: Infrastructure development trends
Development Pressure: Composite metric of urbanization drivers
Accessibility Metrics: Distance to cities and road density
